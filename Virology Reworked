## Overview 
Virology existed in the past and for the most part was very static and boring, as well as generally unpleasant to deal with. This proposal is hopefully going to make Virology as a job more interesting, as well as habe more impact on a round.

## Viruses
At the start of a round, a majority if not all of the crew should start with some sort of benign effect virus (will explain more later about benign versus active viruses).
These viruses initially won't have any effects to the crew carrying said viruses, but later as the round progresses can mutate based on various factors.
Viruses can be identified and tracked using a similar system to the detective DNA sequencing and collected by crew using sterile swabs on individuals, or by taking blood samples from crew. Method of sample collection will determine which, if any viruses are collected. These samples can then be inserted into the medical diagnoser (or something else but we have the machine for it) to determine the 6 core characteristics of the virus.

## Viral Characteristics 
Viruses will have 4 of 6 characteristics that the virologist can detect using the diagnoser. Symptoms, which can have many potential symptoms the virologist can see to assess who has what disease potentially.
Volatility, which would operate on a sliding scale of how likely the virus is to mutate, and how severe the potential mutations can be using a random weighted point buy, similar to botany chem mutations.
Estimated lifespan of the virus before it eventually "dies".
Lastly, there'd be the mode of contagion spread. Most likely to spread would be airborne, least likely to spread would be blood to blood contact (this will also require medical to sterilize their tools, which will be discussed later). Contagion types can stack.
Not shown to the virologist would be wether or not the virus is capable of jumping species type, nor the major health effect related to such an event occurring. 

## Viral Mutations
Viruses on their own will all start with a benign type symptom, or, the carrier of the virus won't know it exists. Over time, viruses will pass between crew naturally through normal work, physical contact, being near each other, and potential medical malpractice with improperly sterilized tools. 
As the viruses transfer between hosts, there would be a variable chance for the virus to mutate based on the volatility rating of the virus (min of about 10% and max of 75%). When the virus mutates, it can select from a (hopefully) large list of symptoms and maladies, from literally nothing, to a cough or fever, to a series of more lethal traits like coughing blood, blindness, ecetra.

## Combating Viruses
Cleanliness will go a long way to preventing viruses from getting out of hand. Medical tools, such as syringes will have a high chance to pick up viruses and transfer them between patients if the syringes are not sterilized properly. This can be done via a sterilization machine which would need to be added inside of medical, or in a pinch, you can use liquid soaps or space cleaners to attempt to clean syringes if you're in a rush, but with a much reduced probability of success.
Alternatively, virologists can attempt to create vaccines to the virus in question, in order to create a vaccine, the virologist would need to provide multiple samples of the virus to the vaccinatior machine, which will then synthesize a vaccine with a hidden success probability based on the volatility of the target virus. Vaccine production will require *something* to actually create the vaccine. 
A successful vaccine will prevent the specific virus the vaccine is created for from jumping to any person who has not already been infected by the vaccine, but will not prevent any mutation of the same virus eventually coming around and infecting later.

## Infection Sources
Viruses that don't originate in the crew round start can be instead picked up from other sources, such as raw meats in the kitchen, not cleaning meat cutting tools in the kitchen, rats and mice, artifacts creating (usually very lethal) diseases, and sometimes external sources, such as carp bites, vent spider bites, and potentially bio terror from nukkies.
This is mostly done so the crew can't somehow systematically wipe out viruses.
